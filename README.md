Marine particle image classification. The modules included here are used for training ensembles of models on different subsets of training data to estimate in- and out-of-domain performance. Training data not yet included.

In developing the modules in this repository, I referenced the [CV4Ecology summer school GitHub page](https://github.com/CV4EcologySchool) and several [PyTorch tutorials](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/index.html).
