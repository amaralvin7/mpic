Redo hitloopII with new organizational scheme. Results are not exactly the same because of the order that training and validation filepaths show up in the .json splits files, but check_splits.py confirms that the elements of the splits files are identical. Conclusions of the results still hold compared to results from 20231123 when considering model variance, but here the results from the MAE figure are more convincing for minboost compared to verify.
