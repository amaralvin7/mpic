Human in-the-loop experiments, with RR as the target domain.
- A: Human labels for all unambiguous images including in training, predict on only ambiguous images.
- B: No RR in training, totally out of domain.
- C: For each majority class (N >= 100 in train set), find all images that had a unanimous prediction from model B. Include up to the top 1000 of such images from each class.
- D: C, plus human verification
- E: D, plus human-verified minority classes as well
