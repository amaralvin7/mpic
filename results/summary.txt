Redo hitloopII, but with only in-domain images in the train and val sets (80/20 split).

Verify and minboost are still the best, but not much difference between the two. Top1k already shifts the distribution of the training set (e.g., aggregates and long pellets are about equally represented but we know that aggregates should be more abundant). When we minboost, we further skew the training distribution away from the target distribution, which may lead, for example, to underestimating aggregates.
