Redoing hitloopII, but with different splits. Training sets now include all OOD images. In domain images are added via a 50/50 class stratified split to the train and val sets.

Results are comparable to before, but MAE for total and measured seem to be a bit worse. Perhaps because fewer in-domain images in the training set?
