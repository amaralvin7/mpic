Compared effects of normalization, model architecture (resnet18 vs. resnet50), and batch size on model performance. For out-of-domain prediction, these hyperparams made little difference. For in-domain (i.e., predicting on the validation set), larger batch and model improved performance, but using normalization degraded it. Maybe try using ImageNet stats in the future.
