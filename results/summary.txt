Human in-the-loop experiments, with RR as the target domain.
- A: Human labels for all unambiguous images including in training, predict on only ambiguous images.
- B: No RR in training, totally out of domain.
- C: Include top 200 RR predictions for each class from each of the B model replicates in the training set.
- D: Like C, but with human verification of the top 200 predictions.
- E: For each class, find all images that had a unanimous prediction from model B. Include the top 200 of such images from each class.
- F: Like E, but with 400 images rather than 200.
- G: Like F, but with human verification.

Outcome: D was often the best model, followed by F or G (G better in total and measured flux comparisons, likely due to large imrpovement in long_pellet). Surprising that G was not better than D, but this might be due to a single class (short_pellet).
